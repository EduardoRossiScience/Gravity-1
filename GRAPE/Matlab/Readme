The following version of the code has been written in Matlab. 
A userguide manual is present in the folder where the external user can learn how to use the package.

The Matlab version of GRAPE uses two built-in functions (inpolyhedron.m and stlread.m) that are downloaded from the Matlab File Exchange page.

The author of the "inpolyhedron.m" function is Sven Holcomb, who deserves all the copyright for this.
The "stlread.m" version used in GRAPE was originally downloaded from the File Exchange, is now a built-in function in more updated released. In any case all the copyright for this function belogs to Mathworks Inc.
